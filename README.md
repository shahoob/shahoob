### how to get this on your github profile

1. create a repo with the name of your github username (with casing)
2. make a `README.md` file
3. do whatever with that file (write it like a normal `README.md` as you would, but also check out some templates, it may help you)
4. make the repo public (if not public and is private)
5. done
